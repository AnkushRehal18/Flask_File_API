# flask_file_api

A Flask-based API that accepts file uploads, converts them to a desired format, and returns the converted file.

---

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask_file_api.git
cd flask_file_api
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment named `venv` (you can choose another name if you like):

- On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

- On Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

- On Windows (Command Prompt):

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Flask app

```bash
python app.py
```

(or replace `app.py` with your main application filename)

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

## Notes

- Add a `.gitignore` file and include the `venv/` folder to avoid committing your virtual environment.
- Make sure your `requirements.txt` is up to date with all dependencies.
- Document your API endpoints here for users to understand how to interact with your service.
